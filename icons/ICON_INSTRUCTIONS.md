# Icon Instructions

This extension needs three icon files to display properly in Chrome:

## Required Files

1. **icon16.png** (16x16 pixels) - Used in the extensions menu
2. **icon48.png** (48x48 pixels) - Used in the extensions management page
3. **icon128.png** (128x128 pixels) - Used in the Chrome Web Store

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Download Pre-made Icons
1. Search for "Twitter bird icon PNG" on Google Images
2. Download high-quality versions
3. Resize to 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
4. Save them in this folder with the correct names

### Option 2: Use a Favicon Generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/ or similar service
2. Upload a Twitter bird logo image
3. Generate icons in the required sizes
4. Download and rename them appropriately

### Option 3: Create Manually
1. Use an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Create a new image with Twitter blue background (#1DA1F2)
3. Add the Twitter bird logo in white
4. Export as PNG in the required sizes

## Quick Fix for Testing

If you just want to test the extension without proper icons:
1. Create simple blue square PNG files in the required sizes
2. The extension will work fine, just without pretty icons
3. You can always add better icons later

## Color Reference

- Twitter Blue: #1DA1F2
